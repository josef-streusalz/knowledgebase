# Teaching KnowledgeBase

This private repository contains all teaching subprojects (e.g. , plus any future topics).  
**All code under subfolders is versioned**, but **any folder named `data/` is excluded** (via .gitignore).

Current subproject layout:
- scFates/
  - data/      ← large data, ignored by Git
  - scripts/   ← R/Python scripts (committed here)
- (future subprojects will follow the same pattern)
